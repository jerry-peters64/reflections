How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Makes is easier to revert back to a previous working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
If you forget to commit, you are out of luck.
ALso, if your program or machine crashes, you will lose all work after last commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because the files are inter-related and dependant on each other.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
By using the control number for 2 commits, git will show the differences between the files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because it will be easy to find the differences and quickly change them back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
To clone and view sample projects I have seen.
